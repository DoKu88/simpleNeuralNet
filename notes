General Plan 
1. Define a Linked List Abstract Factory for our nodes of computation 
2. The abstract factory should have abstract methods: 
   - forward(input), backward(gradient)
   - fields: next, prev
3. Need to have the following concrete implementations for the abstract factory 
   - loss
   - sigmoid
   - ReLU
   - layer_linear
   - layer_matrix 
      - need to see how to implement gradients for this one 

I think we shoud just start simple and get something simple to work 
and then later try to implement this abstract factory

Ok, let's just start from the math and make objects for each aspect of the network
1. Activation function sigma(z)
   Derivative wrt activation sigma 
2. Wx + b 
   a. Derivative wrt W 
   b. Derivative wrt b 

For each layer we need: 
1. Derivative wrt W 
2. Derivative wrt b 
3. Derivative wrt prev sigma
