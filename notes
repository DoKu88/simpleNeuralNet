General Plan 
1. Define a Linked List Abstract Factory for our nodes of computation 
2. The abstract factory should have abstract methods: 
   - forward(input), backward(gradient)
   - fields: next, prev
3. Need to have the following concrete implementations for the abstract factory 
   - loss
   - sigmoid
   - ReLU
   - layer_linear
   - layer_matrix 
      - need to see how to implement gradients for this one 

I think we shoud just start simple and get something simple to work 
and then later try to implement this abstract factory
